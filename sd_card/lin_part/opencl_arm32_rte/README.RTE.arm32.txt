Altera Cyclone V SoC Runtime Environment for OpenCL Release 14.1 README.TXT
===========================================================================
 
This README.txt file accompanies the Altera(R) Cyclone(R) V SoC Runtime
Environment (RTE) for OpenCL(TM) version 14.1.

OpenCL and the OpenCL logo are trademarks of Apple Inc., used by
permission of the Khronos Group(TM).

The RTE is a companion to the Altera Software Development Kit (SDK) for
OpenCL of the same version. The RTE supports a subset of the features
available in the SDK.  Use this RTE to compile and execute host programs
in a Cyclone V SoC Linux environment.

IMPORTANT: You must compile OpenCL device programs with the Altera SDK
for OpenCL of the same version.

This version of the RTE is an implementation of the Khronos
OpenCL Specification version 1.0, and it passes the Khronos OpenCL
Conformance Testing Process. Current conformance status can be found
at http://www.khronos.org/conformance.

Please refer to the Altera RTE for OpenCL Getting Started Guide and
the Altera SDK for OpenCL Programming Guide for a summary of supported
features.

Although we have made every effort to ensure that this version of
the Altera RTE for OpenCL software functions correctly, there might be
problems that we have not encountered. If you have a question or problem
that is not answered by the information provided in the documentation,
please contact Altera support at 1-800-800-EPLD, or submit a service
request at mysupport.altera.com.
